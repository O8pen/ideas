At the university there is always theoritical class is given, after that there is practical class.

This is utter most bullshit thing I have ever seen.

You will never understand that theoritical part and you will wish that you will die.
Nothing will stick to your brain.

You need to do the practical class then you need to suplement/polish the things with theoritical
class. Then you will have motivation to listen to theoritical class.

In gaming, you need to play the game first, then if you want to become a pro you can read the 
wiki. No one read the wiki first, then plays the game. Dont be fucking stupid.
Everything is wrong with that education system. I want to change it.
