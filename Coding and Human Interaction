I have written that idea couple of times before, but I need to repeat it and make some additions.

It is impossible to just sit infront of a text file (no sound, no human interactions) and read or write into that text file.

You need to artifically create human interaction. Either you can open a youtube tutorial video at the side, or a music that has an unrelated lyrics to what you are working on.

You have managed to read the entire ml-agents docs because of there was a readme chrome extension text-to-speech.
If there were no text to speech you couldn't read that thing.

10hours10Jsproject video have thought you about html css and js. If you have to sit through an entire text formatted tutorial, probably you would be bored and couldn't finnish it.

-   You need to trick your mind
-   TTS or Youtube Tutorials
-   Discord servers or Twitch streaming can work too
-   There should be artifical human interaction
